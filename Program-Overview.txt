Notes:

Windows Install of Imports:
* Python Speech Recognition Module: pip install speechrecognition
* Python pyttsx3 Module: pip install pyttsx3 - You can change voice, speed and volume
* If pyttsx3 is outdated: python.exe -m pip install --upgrade pip

MacOS Install of Imports:
* pip3 install speechrecognition
* brew install python3-pyaudio
* pip3 install pyaudio

Code Notes:

* adjust_for_ambient_noise is a method of the recognizer class from the speech_recognition package
* (source2, duration=0.2), it listens to the background noise for a short time, and adjusts the microphone 
  sensitivity (use calibrate). If you increase the duration, the calibration is better but there;s a short 
  wait before it starts listening to you

* f = open("output.txt", "a"), the "a" means append, so it will add to the end of the file instead of overwriting it
